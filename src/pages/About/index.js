          ✋ Hello, I'm Samet Karakus. Life is all about how you set and execute
          your priorities.
        </strong>
        <br />
        When I started these things in 2015, I was just developing my desktop
        software 🧑‍💻. During my high school years, I developed freelance
        desktop applications and i earned money 👨🏻‍💻 = 💲. Freelance Software
        Development has made me able to experience the whole process besides
        improving my frontend skills 😎. As a result, I can make better time
        management and give accurate deadlines in freelance or contractor
        projects 👔.
        <br />
        At the moment I am software developing for i supported startups and I am
        mentoring software teams.
        <br />
        Also I am trying to share my knowledge and experience on my conferences.
