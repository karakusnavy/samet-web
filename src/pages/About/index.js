        Hello, I'm Samet Karakus. Life is all about how you set and execute your
        priorities.
        <br />
        When I started these things in 2015, I was just developing my desktop
        software. During my high school years, I developed freelance desktop
        applications and i earned money. Freelance Software Development has made
        me able to experience the whole process besides improving my frontend
        skills. As a result, I can make better time management and give accurate
        deadlines in freelance or contractor projects.
        <br />
        At the moment I am software developing for i supported startups and I am
        mentoring software teams.
        <br />
        Also I am trying to share my knowledge and experience on my conferences.
      </p>
